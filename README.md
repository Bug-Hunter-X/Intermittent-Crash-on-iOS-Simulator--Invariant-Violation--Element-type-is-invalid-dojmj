This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in an Expo React Native application where the app intermittently crashes on the iOS simulator with the error: 'Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined'. The bug is difficult to reproduce consistently, making debugging challenging. The provided code displays a simple view with an image, but the crash happens unpredictably during development.  The solution involves identifying and correcting potential asynchronous operations or conditional rendering issues that may be causing the undefined element type.
